# Analysis_NewYork_Taxi

*Overview*
This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing New York taxi data using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression model. The analysis aims to predict taxi fares based on various features such as pickup location, drop-off location, time of day, and day of the week.

*Dependencies*
1. Python 3.x
2. Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the code interactively)
3. Required libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib

*Usage*
1. Data Preparation
   Place the downloaded taxi trip data in the data/ directory.

2. Running the Analysis
   Open and run the Jupyter Notebook notebooks/taxi_analysis.ipynb to perform the analysis interactively.

3. Viewing Results
   The notebook will guide you through the data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It will also include visualizations using the Matplotlib library to help understand the data and model predictions.
